These systems effectively address the problem of choice overload, enabling users to navigate through vast amount of options with ease. By accurately predicting user preferences, recommender systems enhance user experience and satisfaction. They are widely employed across various domains, offering personalized recommendations that cater to individual needs and interest.\n","Recommender system employs three different approaches to generate recommendations, collaborative filtering, content based filtering and hybrid approach.\n","\n","\n","In the domain of food, recommender systems are utilized in various contexts such as restaurant suggestions, grocery store item personalization, and recipe recommendations. Creating an accurate food recommender system is complex due to the multifaceted nature of the food domain, which involves context, location, health preferences, and more.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IFXMlYQ5DDhZ"},"source":["## Problem Formulation\n","\n","Deciding what and where to eat is challenging due to the vast array of available options. Online food recommender systems aim to help users find relevant food items and recipes. However, previous studies show that these systems often promote unhealthy food choices. This is primarily due to user-generated content that favors unhealthy options and the use of datasets that do not comply with health metrics like the Food Standards Agency (FSA) score and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.\n","\n","The goal of this project is to develop a ranking food recommender system that suggests top recipe recommendations. A subsequent healthiness filter will rank these recommendations based on the healthiness of the recipes, using the FSA score. The recommendation generation will be based on the well-known Two-Tower architecture, a popular deep learning approach for building recommender systems.\n","\n","\n","The proposed model will be evaluated against a baseline: a traditional Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) collaborative filtering model. User recipe ratings will be used to assess the effectiveness of both models.\n","\n","The future application of this project will involve conducting a user study to provide personalized recommendations using the Two-Tower deep learning model to predict personalized recipes according to each user preference and features. A healthiness filter algorithm will select the healthiest recipes to present to users. The key evaluative question will be:\n","\n","To what extent does a highly personalized recommender system nudge users toward healthier food choices?\n","\n","This notebook is organized into the following sections:\n","\n","- **Dataset:** Overview of the dataset used to train the model\n","- **Model Architecture:** Details of the Two-Tower deep neural network\n","- **SVD Baseline:** Description of the baseline collaborative filtering model\n","- **Evaluation:** Results and evaluations of the developed models"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"L0qCdhoQDDha"},"source":["## Dataset\n","\n","The dataset that we will use in this project is collected during the course line of my PhD project and the user experiments that we condactated as mean to evaluate our propesed recommender systems and digital nudges.
